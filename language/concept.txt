The validator will read cfg content from a file and verify if it is syntactically correct.

The file in which the cfg will be written should follow a specific format:
    Tokens : <list of tokens separated by commas> .         Note : This list can be empty
                                                            Note : We will not use the or logic for simplicity.
        prodHead -> prodBody ;                                      If a prodHead has two heads write it two times. 
        .
        .


    example:
        Tokens : identifier, number.
            assignment -> identifier '=' number ';' ;
